# Choco Up Frontend Code Test

## Background
You are going to rebuild our [www.choco-up.com](https://www.choco-up.com) **home page** with your own code. You don't need to finish the whole page, just to complete the 5 parts is fine (see the `layout.png` in red outline).

## Guidelines
- Build with `React.js` or related framework
- Javascript/Typescript is acceptable
- Choose your own library/plugin to help you finish the test
- You can follow our current layout design or you can design your own, just use the **content** from the 5 parts of the home page
- `README.md` is required to explain how you design the frontend structure
- Responsive is important!

## API exercises
In order to test your API skill, for the `client testimonials` part from the layout, please use the following dummyJSON API to get the user:
- https://dummyjson.com/docs/users
- Please show at least `6` testimonial content from the api
- For the quote text please use dummyJSON user's address; For the job title please use dummyJSON user's email

## How you will be scored
- Frameworks/libraries/plugins choices and use it right
- Git workflow
- Code quality 
- Folder structure, e.g.
	- Organize components, contents
- Documentation in `README.md`, e.g.
	- Packages/library you used
	- Development guidelines
	- Assumptions or thoughts
	- Folder structure
	- ...(as much as you can think of)

## Tips
- Treat it like you are going to pass this project to client after completion, production ready. And also think about how client side developer would need to know or do in order to deploy the website and maintain the code
- You don't need to spend too much time to finish the test. We don't need a perfect site but just want to see how much you can do. (Suggestion: Submit within a week)

## Deliverables
- Create a `public` repository and share the link to us
